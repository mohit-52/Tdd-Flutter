# Flutter Clean Architecture TDD BLoC Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Clean Architecture** principles in a Flutter application using **BLoC** for state management. It adopts a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach to ensure robust and maintainable code, making it a practical example for developers aiming to build scalable applications with Flutter.

## Project Architecture

### 1. **Domain Layer**
   - Defines core business logic, entities, and use cases.
   - Independent of external frameworks.

### 2. **Data Layer**
   - Handles data sources (API, local database).
   - Responsible for implementing repositories.

### 3. **Presentation Layer**
   - Manages UI and state using **BLoC** and **Cubit**.
   - Provides a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Development Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
  - Over 100 test cases are implemented to validate functionality.
  - Ensures high code quality and reliability.
