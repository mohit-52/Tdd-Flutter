# Flutter Clean Architecture TDD BLoC Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Clean Architecture** principles in a Flutter application using **BLoC** for state management. It adopts a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach to ensure robust and maintainable code, making it a practical example for developers aiming to build scalable applications with Flutter.
